High-Performance 2D Spatial Search Engine (‚Ñì‚àû-Distance)
A specialized spatial database in C++ engineered for highly efficient proximity searches on a 2D point set. The system is optimized for orthogonal range queries using the Chebyshev (‚Ñì‚àû) distance, which is crucial in applications like logistics, microchip design, and game development where movement is constrained to a grid.

Project Overview
This project implements a high-performance 2D spatial database using a 2D Range Tree data structure. It's designed to rapidly find all data points within a specified square-shaped region around a query point, a common requirement in many computational fields.

Key Applications
Geospatial Systems: Quickly finding "nearby" points of interest (e.g., restaurants, stores) on a grid-like map.

Logistics & Planning: Optimizing delivery routes where costs are based on the maximum axis-aligned displacement.

Game Development: Efficient collision detection or selecting objects within a character's field of view.

VLSI Design: Locating components within a specific bounding box for layout verification and analysis.

Features & Performance
‚ö°Ô∏è Efficient Construction: The PointDatabase is built in O(nlogn) time for n data points, allowing for quick setup even with large datasets.

üöÄ Rapid Proximity Search: Queries for points within an ‚Ñì‚àû-distance d of a query point q are resolved in O(log 
2
 n+m) time, where m is the number of points returned.

üßä ‚Ñì‚àû-Distance Core: Specifically designed to handle the Chebyshev distance, which defines a square-shaped query region, as opposed to Euclidean (circular) or Manhattan (diamond-shaped) distances.

üß© Integer Coordinate Support: Built for integer coordinates to avoid floating-point precision issues, ideal for grid-based systems.

How ‚Ñì‚àû-Distance Search Works
The ‚Ñì‚àû-distance (Chebyshev distance) between two points p_1=(x_1,y_1) and p_2=(x_2,y_2) is defined as:

L 
‚àû
‚Äã
 =max(‚à£x 
1
‚Äã
 ‚àíx 
2
‚Äã
 ‚à£,‚à£y 
1
‚Äã
 ‚àíy 
2
‚Äã
 ‚à£)
When searching for points within a distance d from a query point q=(q_x,q_y), we are looking for all points p=(x,y) that satisfy:

q_x‚àíd‚â§x‚â§q_x+d
AND
q_y‚àíd‚â§y‚â§q_y+d

This defines an axis-aligned square centered at q with a side length of 2d.

Data Structure: 2D Range Tree
The performance of this database comes from its underlying 2D Range Tree.

Primary Tree (X-coordinates): The main structure is a balanced binary search tree built on the x-coordinates of all data points.

Associated Trees (Y-coordinates): Each node in the primary X-tree contains an associated balanced binary search tree (the "auxiliary tree"). This Y-tree stores all the points from the primary node's subtree, but sorted by their y-coordinates.

Querying: A search for a square region [x_min, x_max] x [y_min, y_max] efficiently traverses the primary X-tree to find points within the x-range. For qualifying subtrees, it then performs a 1D range query on their associated Y-trees to find points within the y-range, drastically pruning the search space.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Example Usage
The main.cpp file contains a simple demonstration of how to use the PointDatabase.

C++


```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include "PointDatabase.h" // Assuming the class is in this header

int main() {
    // 1. Define your list of points
    std::vector<Point> points = {
        {38, 26}, {43, 24}, {5, 25}, {30, 2}, {29, 7}, {37, 16},
        {51, 15}, {40, 23}, {23, 20}, {8, 49}, {34, 45}, {42, 12},
        {32, 39}, {17, 19}, {12, 4}
    };

    // 2. Create the database object
    PointDatabase db(points);

    // 3. Perform a search query for points near (20, 40) with distance 37.9
    std::vector<Point> nearby_points = db.searchNearby({20, 40}, 37.9);

    // 4. Print the results
    std::cout << "Points near (20, 40) with d=37.9:" << std::endl;
    for (const auto& p : nearby_points) {
        std::cout << "(" << p.x << ", " << p.y << ")" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
