# Spatial-Search-Engine
Developed a specialized spatial database in C++, engineered to perform highly efficient proximity searches on a 2D point set. The system is optimized for orthogonal range queries using the Chebyshev (ℓ∞) distance, which is crucial in applications like logistics, microchip design, and game development where movement is constrained to a grid.
